Problem: create a task planner for the work day

- display date on top
- ^dynamically changes

- set hours: 9am - 5pm (workday hours)
    - past hours gray out
    - current hour is red/yellow
    - upcoming hours are green
- ^dynamically change with time 

- saveBtn allows user to save their input
    - save into local storage -> when refresh, will stay

- (notes clear upon new day)
